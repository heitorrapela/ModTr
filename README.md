This repository contains the code used for Modality Translation for Object Detection Adaptation Without Forgetting Prior Knowledge ðŸ”— by Heitor Rapela Medeiros, Masih Aminbeidokhti, Fidel Guerrero Pena, David Latortue, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli (ECCV 2024). 

P.S. The code will be released soon. Max one week after the camera-ready, because I am working on another project right now.
